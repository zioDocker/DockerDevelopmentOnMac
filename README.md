# nfsForDockerForMac
boot nfs for Docker for Mac Projects
---

This repo has the purpose to start NFS on Mac OS, in order to use it with Docker for Mac and speed up the filesystem.

This scipt is inspired from this [gist repo](https://gist.github.com/seanhandley/7dad300420e5f8f02e7243b7651c6657#file-setup_native_nfs_docker_osx-sh) and is resuming the solution coming from [this discussion](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1592)

## How use it
clone this repo in your future project:
```
git clone git@github.com:ridesoft/nfsForDockerForMac.git {my-project}
```

Go to your new project, remove the git directory and start to create your new project with your new repo or add your new project like a git submodule

[Here and example](https://github.com/ridesoft/magento2ceDevEnvironment) about how this could work with a repo handling Magento2.
